GoMock is a mocking framework for the [Go programming language][golang]. It
integrates well with Go's built-in `testing` package, but can be used in other
contexts too.

Installation
------------

Once you have [installed Go][golang-install], simply run the following commands
to install the `gomock` package and the `mockgen` tool:

    goinstall github.com/dsymonds/gomock/gomock
    goinstall github.com/dsymonds/gomock/mockgen

TODO: How to run mockgen, brief overview of how to create mock objects and set
up expectations, links to documentation, and an example.
